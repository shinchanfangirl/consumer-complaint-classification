# Consumer-Complaint-Classification

- **Problem:** Each week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sends thousands of consumerâ€™s complaints about financial product and services to company for a response. Classify those consumer complaints into the product category it belongs to using the description of the complaint.
- **Solution:** The goal of this project is to classify the complaint into a specific product category. Since it has multiple categories, it becomes a multiclass classification that can be solved through many of the machine learning algorithms. 
- Once the algorithm is in place, whenever there is a new complaint, we can easily categorize it nad can then be redirected to the concerned person. This will save a lot of time because we are minimizing the human interventions to decide whom this complaint should go to.
